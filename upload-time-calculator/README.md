# Upload Time Calculator

This simple static webpage allows you to estimate how long it will take to upload a file based on the file size and your network's upload speed. The page uses colors inspired by **Dematic** branding.

## Running Locally
Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages
1. Commit the `upload-time-calculator` folder to your repository.
2. Push to GitHub.
3. In your repository settings on GitHub, enable **GitHub Pages** and choose the branch (e.g., `main`) and the `/root` folder (`/`).
4. After a few moments, your site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/upload-time-calculator/`.

The project is self-contained with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in this folder, so it can be hosted directly via GitHub Pages.
